# Chat System
This chat system is a project developed using JavaScript, jQuery, Ajax, PHP, HTML, and CSS. It allows multiple users to chat in real-time on an online platform.

## Instructions
To use this chat system, simply download the project files and place them on a PHP server. Then, open the "index.html" file in a web browser to access the user interface.

Users can enter their username and start chatting in real-time with other connected users. Sent and received messages are stored in a database and displayed in real-time using Ajax.
